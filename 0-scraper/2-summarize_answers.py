Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

Here are some examples:

Technical Q&A 1:
Q: When should OTA Requestors invoke the ApplyUpdateRequest command?
A: OTA Requestors should invoke the ApplyUpdateRequest command once they are ready to apply a previously downloaded Software Image. This command is part of the OTA update process and signals readiness for installation. The timing of invocation is critical for proper software updates.

Extracted key sentences:
OTA Requestors should invoke the ApplyUpdateRequest command once they are ready to apply a previously downloaded Software Image.

Technical Q&A 2:
Q: What does the 'WiFiSecurityBitmap' data type encode?
A: The 'WiFiSecurityBitmap' data type encodes the supported Wi-Fi security types present in the Security field of the WiFiInterfaceScanResultStruct. This bitmap allows devices to indicate which security protocols they support. The encoding ensures interoperability between different WiFi-capable Matter devices.

Extracted key sentences:
The 'WiFiSecurityBitmap' data type encodes the supported Wi-Fi security types present in the Security field of the WiFiInterfaceScanResultStruct.

Technical Q&A 3:
Q: How does the Matter protocol handle device commissioning?
A: The Matter protocol uses a multi-step commissioning flow that begins with device discovery using DNS-SD. The commissioner then establishes a secure PASE session with the commissionee using a setup code. After successful authentication, the commissioner provisions operational credentials and network configuration to the device.

Technical Q&A 4:
Q: What is the purpose of the GroupKeyManagement cluster?
A: The GroupKeyManagement cluster is responsible for managing group keys used in Matter group communications. It maintains a list of GroupKeySet entries that contain the keys and associated metadata for each group. The cluster provides commands for adding, removing, and updating group keys to ensure secure multicast communication.
