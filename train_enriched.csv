Additionally, the Administrator associates the group ID (GID) with the key set (K) by writing an entry to the GroupKeyMap list attribute. Once the key material is distributed and associated with the Node, the Node subscribes to the IPv6 multicast address generated from the fabric ID and group ID. Finally, the Administrator associates the endpoint with the group ID (GID) by sending the AddGroup command to the endpoint. This process ensures that the newly commissioned Node has access to the necessary key material and is seamlessly integrated into the group communication network, enabling secure communication with other group members."

The process begins with the Administrator generating a fabric-unique group ID (GID) and a random key (key0) for the group key set ID (K). Subsequently, the Administrator writes the group key set (K) to the remote Node, known as the GroupMember, using the KeySetWrite command. Additionally, the Administrator associates the group ID (GID) with the key set (K) by writing an entry to the GroupKeyMap list attribute. Once the key material is distributed and associated with the Node, the Node subscribes to the IPv6 multicast address generated from the fabric ID and group ID. Finally, the Administrator associates the endpoint with the group ID (GID) by sending the AddGroup command to the endpoint. This process ensures that the newly commissioned Node has access to the necessary key material and is seamlessly integrated into the group communication network, enabling secure communication with other group members."

By adding both the controlling device (e.g., a light switch) and the target devices (e.g., light bulbs) to the same multicast group and setting up bindings for relevant clusters, the controlling device can send multicast commands that are received and executed by all group members. This process involves commissioning devices to the same network, using the CHIP Tool to add devices to the multicast group, configuring cluster bindings, and ensuring bindings persist across device reboots."
What are the requirements for Nodes sending group messages regarding the usage of operational group keys derived from epoch keys?,"Nodes sending group messages within the Matter protocol must participate in Group Key Management: obtaining and managing operational group keys securely. They must use operational group keys to encrypt group messages using the AES-128-CCM algorithm, ensuring confidentiality. By meeting these requirements, nodes maintain secure, efficient, and reliable group communication within a Matter-enabled network."

The server responds with an error status code, specifically NEEDS_TIMED_INTERACTION (Status Code 0x09), signaling that the requested operation must be performed within a Timed Interaction context. If a client sends a Write Request indicating the need for a Timed Write transaction without an active Timed Interaction, the server will reject the request and respond with the NEEDS_TIMED_INTERACTION status code."
